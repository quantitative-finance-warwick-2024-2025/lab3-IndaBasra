Observations:
1. The fastest function is Fibonacci with loop, which is double the speed of the tail recursive version and may
orders of magnitude faster than the recrusive version.

2. The (non-tail) recrusive version is the slowest, which is expected, since every function
call requires a new stack frame to be created.

3. Since the debug disables optimisation. All three functions in release builds are
faster.
